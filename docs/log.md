# Log

What has run, what it showed, and what is open. Everything that changes
with time lives here; the other documents state only what stays true.
Entries are dated, newest first, and an entry is not edited after it is
superseded: a later entry says what changed. Each entry names its
release, what was searched, the held-out numbers, and what remains UNRUN.

## State of the plan

Updated with each entry. The steps are those of the
[plan](methodology.md#plan).

| Step | State | Can reuse | Not built |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 Setup | done (2026-11-11) | | |
| 2 Phase 0 as a release | UNRUN | step data and both teachers as releases; the link split (`train.data.link_key`) | the student with a k-latent layer and its heads; the value head's targets (the teacher graphs hold no critic) |
| 3 Black-box teacher, DAgger students | UNRUN | a recurrent actor on raw measurements (`train ppo`, `inputs: "raw"`), trained by PPO, TD3+BC or DAgger; closed-loop rollouts and scoring | DAgger from a teacher given as a graph (today's teacher is a rule or an actor on the true LCFs); the bottlenecked student in the closed loop; the information-bottleneck term |
| 4 Grounding | UNRUN | the labels and the step message in `steps.parquet` | the library, the fits, the stability and sensitivity checks |
| 5 Retrain and compare | UNRUN | `train run` for net1 and an offline net2; `train ppo` for a closed-loop net2; oracles on the seven LCFs | labels from fitted formulas; net1 on them; the live truth for them |

No claim (C1 to C5) has evidence from a release.

## Open items

- **Targets for the value head.** The teacher graphs are policies and
  come without a critic, and a rule has none at all. Q-values on a grid
  of actions need a critic fitted to each teacher first.
- **Missing base variables.** The emulator does not label the arrival
  rate of all flows, the flow's own arrival rate or the number of active
  flows ([concepts.md](concepts.md#what-this-means-for-compact)). Without
  them grounding cannot return a concept about demand or about the other
  flows. They should be added before step 4, and data used for grounding
  must be generated after that.
- **The scale of retained performance** ([methodology.md](methodology.md#retained-performance)).
- **The threshold for C3**, and the choice rule for the knee in C1.
- **The links, conditions and episode lengths** of the closed-loop
  evaluation, to be fixed in step 3's experiment file.
- **The kind of output** the retrained net1 states (value, interval or
  distribution).
- **Live truth for new concepts.** The guest gives a policy the true
  values of the seven LCFs only, and labels are computed when an episode
  is processed ([architecture.md](architecture.md#known-limits)). The
  oracle net2 of step 5 and labels for fitted formulas need both
  extended.

## 2026-11-11: setup

- **Documents.** Rewritten for compact: the question, claims, terms,
  protocol and plan ([methodology.md](methodology.md)), the emulator
  ([architecture.md](architecture.md), [validation.md](validation.md)),
  the commands ([training.md](training.md)) and the literature's
  candidate concepts ([concepts.md](concepts.md)).
- **Phase 0 inputs as releases of this repository.** The two teachers:
  [`exp-phase0-teachers-1`](https://github.com/Radonux/compact/releases/tag/exp-phase0-teachers-1)
  (`teachers/rule-bdp.onnx` and `teachers/td3bc.onnx`, 16,152,577 bytes
  each, SHA-256 in the release notes). The step data:
  [`exp-phase0-steps-2`](https://github.com/Radonux/compact/releases/tag/exp-phase0-steps-2)
  (20 complete shards, 2.2 GB unpacked). Both were copied unchanged by
  `experiments/phase0-teachers.json` and `experiments/phase0-steps.json`,
  whose descriptions record the source. An experiment reads them as
  `"inputs": {"teachers": "release:exp-phase0-teachers-1", "steps":
  "release:exp-phase0-steps-2"}`.
- **Tests.** Without a UML build or the Mahak and Sage checkouts,
  `uv run pytest -q` gave 202 passed and 57 skipped. The UML tests were
  not run locally (UNRUN here; CI runs them).
- **Nothing was trained or evaluated.**

## Before 2026-11-11: the Phase 0 prototype

A prototype ran on 2 CPUs before this repository was set up (its date
was not recorded). It is not a
release, it was not tuned and it has no closed loop, so its numbers are
feasibility signals only and support no claim. They are recorded here as
reported, and nothing below was rerun in this repository. Its scripts
(`build.py`, `student.py`, `ground.py`) are not in the repository; step 2
replaces them.

Setup:

- Data: 300,000 steps from 8 of the 20 shards of the logged step data
  (1,440 links), split by link 70/15/15 with
  `expliccit_env.train.data.link_key`. The data keeps every 6th step, so
  the next state is 60 ms later.
- Teachers, applied to the logged states: the rule teacher
  (`teachers/rule-bdp.onnx`, a window of 2^0.25 times its estimator's
  believed BDP) and the TD3+BC teacher (`teachers/td3bc.onnx`). The graphs
  have a fixed batch dimension of 1; setting dimension 0 of their inputs
  and outputs to a symbolic `N` with the `onnx` package gave identical
  outputs on batches. The target is the action plus log2 of the window,
  which is log2 of the window the teacher sets.
- Student: net1's observation columns (`EXPLICCIT_OBS_COLS`) and log2 of
  the window, an MLP of two 256-unit layers, then z. Heads: the action,
  and the next state (log sRTT, observation index 2, and log delivery
  rate, index 7) with weight 0.5. k in {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 32}, 3 seeds, 20
  epochs of behavioural cloning.
- Library: 12 hidden-state variables from the `label_*` columns and 7
  sender observables, mostly as logs, so a linear fit is a power-law
  product. Fitted on the validation links and scored on the test links.

Reported findings:

1. Positive control. With the action head only, one latent matched the
   unconstrained student for the rule teacher (held-out action R^2 0.969
   against 0.968). Greedy selection over the hidden state picked log
   capacity and then log base RTT (R^2 0.86), which together are log BDP:
   the rule's own concept, recovered without being given.
2. With the next-state head, both teachers level off at k = 3. Without
   it, the rule levels off at k = 1 and TD3+BC at k = 2.
3. The next-state head shapes z. It lowers the action R^2 at k = 1 from
   0.969 to 0.893 and makes the two teachers' latents nearly one subspace
   (linear CKA 0.96). Without it, z is close to the teacher's action
   (linear R^2 0.92 to 0.94), which is the action-collapse risk.
4. With the next-state head and k of 2 or more, the first three greedy
   picks are mostly log receive rate, log base RTT and log1p queueing
   delay (R^2 0.62 to 0.84).
5. The full library fits z linearly with a joint R^2 of 0.73 to 0.93; an
   MLP on the same library reaches 0.92 to 0.99. So the latents are mostly
   nonlinear functions of known variables.
6. Linear CKA between seeds is 0.92 to 0.99; a random 3-dimensional
   projection of the inputs scores 0.42.

The main limitation: both teachers already act through an estimator of
the seven LCFs, so this tests the recovery of a known bottleneck, not discovery.
The knee here is in held-out action R^2 on logged states, while C1 is
about closed-loop performance.
