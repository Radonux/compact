"""Write a campaign on the held-out links of examples/campaign-net1-varied.json.

The links are split by link (the path without its loss), seed 1, 15%
validation and 15% test, as net1 v3's training data was. The campaign runs
the given policies and stock controllers on one split's links under one
family of conditions. Episode seeds are drawn in order from the campaign
seed, so changing the controller list changes every episode's seed; the
pairing is by link and condition.

Families: "training" is that campaign's three conditions (clean, 1% loss,
3 Mbit/s UDP plus a Cubic flow from 8 s). The others are conditions it never
had: "new" (a Cubic flow from 0 s, a BBRv1 flow from 4 s, Cubic flows from
2 s and 10 s, 0.1% and 3% random loss, 1% loss on the ACK path),
"cubic-first" (a Cubic flow from 0 s alone), "deep-long" (the training
conditions on the same links with a 2.5 times longer one-way delay, at most
80 ms, and a buffer of 4 to 16 BDP drawn with seed 31), and
"held-competitors" (a BBRv3 flow from 0 s, a Westwood flow from 0 s: the
competitors net1 v4's training data held out), and "dynamic", for 120 s
episodes, where competitors arrive and leave mid-episode (DYNAMIC), so that
a controller must notice each change and the others' reaction to it.
Two families hold links where the flow cannot keep the link busy, so that
what it does not know has value: "info", the links' own capacity under a
Cubic or a BBRv1 flow that leaves at 10 s, UDP at half the link's mean
capacity on for 2 s and off for 2 s, and Cubic flows on for 3 s and off for
3 s (INFO); and "rise", the flow alone on each link with its capacity
alternating between half and twice its first level every 2 s, a fourfold
rise every 4 s. "cellular" replays real cellular traces (Mahimahi's,
third_party/mahimahi/traces: AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon, LTE, UMTS and
EVDO, measured while driving or still): each link keeps its one-way delay
and its buffer in BDPs, and takes one of the eight traces from an offset
that differs from link to link, with the matching uplink trace for the
ACKs; alone and against a Cubic flow from 0 s. The slices are written
under OUT_DIR/traces. "case-studies" is not a split's links but the two
links of expliCCit's case studies, alone: 24 and 48 Mbit/s alternating
every 7 s with a 40 ms one-way delay and a 1000-packet buffer, and 24
Mbit/s halving to 12 at 40 s with 20 ms and 300 packets.

Usage: python experiments/heldout.py OUT_DIR --split test --duration-ms 60000
           --seed 13 [--family training] --stock all --policy NAME=PATH[@MODE] ...

Writes OUT_DIR/campaign.json and OUT_DIR/aliases.json (agent:SHA12 -> NAME,
for `expliccit score --alias`).
