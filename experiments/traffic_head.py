"""Train net1's traffic head (train/traffic.py) on a campaign's steps.

Reads every c-* campaign under OUT whose steps tables keep the
observations, the observed flow one controller throughout, on training
links; reports the head's balanced accuracy on links held out of its
training (3 folds by link, as experiments/competitor_info.py), then trains
it on every link and saves it as OUT/traffic_head.pt with its width.

Usage: python experiments/traffic_head.py OUT NET1.pt
Writes OUT/summary.md and OUT/traffic_head.pt.
