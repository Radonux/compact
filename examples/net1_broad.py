"""Write a campaign of the broad net1 dataset (net1 v4): many links, each
under two conditions drawn from a broad set, three controllers per link.

Usage: python examples/net1_broad.py OUT_DIR --set SET --models DIR

SET is one of:
  train30, train60  the training data, 30 s and 60 s episodes (competition
                    needs time to settle), on separate links
  ood-competitors   competing flows of controllers no training condition
                    has (BBRv3, Westwood)
  ood-loss          random loss of 3% to 6% (training: at most 2%)
  ood-rtt           one-way delay of 61 to 90 ms (training: 5 to 60 ms)
  ood-buffer        buffers of 8 to 16 BDP (training: 0.25 to 8)
  net2-train        net2's online rollouts on net1 v4: training links and
                    conditions, on links of their own (its controllers are
                    ignored there)
  net2-train-xl     the same with 16 times the links, so that nearly every
                    rollout of a learned net2 runs on a link it has not seen
  wide30, wide120   net1 v6's added data: one-way delay of 5 to 150 ms,
                    buffers of 0.25 to 32 BDP, base capacity of 1 to 200
                    Mbit/s, and 30 s and 120 s episodes, so that slow
                    dynamics (a Reno or Cubic cycle on a large BDP, many
                    capacity steps, late arrivals and departures) play out
  ood-rtt-wide      one-way delay of 151 to 250 ms, otherwise as wide30
  ood-buffer-wide   buffers of 32 to 64 BDP, otherwise as wide30

The held-out sets use training conditions or training links except in the
one family they change. Training links: base capacity 4 to 150 Mbit/s,
constant or stepping 0.25x to 4x every 2 to 20 s. Training conditions: up to
three competing TCP flows (any stock controller but BBRv3 and Westwood),
arriving at the start or later and some leaving early; UDP at 5% to 50% of
the link's capacity; random loss of 0.01% to 2%, and on the ACK path.

Controllers of the observed flow, three per link: the 17 stock ones, the four
delay-threshold policies (examples/policies) and the fixed rule of release
model-net1v3 (DIR/rule-u0.25.onnx), alone and with exploration, so net1 sees
the states net2 visits. BBRv3, Westwood and threshold-0.3 are held out of
net1's training rows when it is trained, as for net1 v3.
